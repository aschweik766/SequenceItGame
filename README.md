# sequenceItGame
This is a education tool and educational game to support executive functioning and memory skills related to daily task sequencing, planning, or general use as a visual support.
What a better way to practice a daily life skill, than through a fun game that supports errorless learning. 

For this game, I have made a an easy level, with all the bells and whistles to support learning a step by step task, such as making a can of soup for onself on the stove. The user can practice ordering or labeling the steps to making a pot of soup, with visual feedback for an error, and opportunity to evaluate a card match choice by selecting the hint buttons. It is impossible to fully drag and drop an incorrect step order onto a picture card that does not match. Rather, the game is going to prompt the player/user through color changes and preventing a drag and drop through the game functionality itself. As well, the user will be able to track their accy through a score counter, as well as through the visaul feedback of correctly ordering cards by step, and watching their divs turn green. 

Stretch goals:
Developing an additional level to challenge the user, so similar cards and layout, but without the errorless learning features such as color changes, and use of hints. 

Developing game levels and topic selections for a variety of daily tasks that require step by step planning and task execution, i.e., bathing routine, taking medications, making coffee, opening and sorting mail. There are so many tasks indivdiuals do on a daily basis that can be reinforced or learned in a simple and interactive game.
